This one has taken an extremley long time to get out the door. Which is ironic, because its probably the shortest one I have other than the [PS2 Graphics Improvements post](https://onecloudemoji.github.io/experiments/games/ps2-graphics/). There is absolutley zero reason why, it has just been sitting in my ever expanding to do list. Given that I think I am just burnt the fuck out on many things in life, including the state of gaming, this might be why I have procrastinated doing many projects in that arena. Once again, I implore you to read my [previous diatribe](https://onecloudemoji.github.io/games/2004-gaming/) on why gaming was objectively better in the past. 

But the onus for getting this finally completed was the release of Diablo 4. There is something very, very wrong with the way a single player game has been morphed into a quasi MMO type experience. There is zero good reason for permament online to be a thing in a SINGLE PLAYER EXPERIENCE. There is no need for anti cheat to be running when I am playing against MYSELF. Fuck you, if I want to hook cheat engine up to revert my XP because I dont like my build, thats MY FUCKING BUSINESS.

I am sure there are positive things to say about D4. I dont know what they are and I dont care to find out. Especially since I can have what I can say is going to be a more fun experience by shooting fireballs across the damn map like some medieval sniper in a game that is nearly a quarter of a century old.

But my diablo 2 doesnt look like that! No, out of the box it wont. Here is a simple series of steps to acheive this. Much like the xxx Diablo 1 on linux project, this entire series has been documented either nowhere or nowhere I found. So ONCE AGAIN I have been forced to conduct these experiments manually my damn self.

* install original d2, single player only

* run the d3d  test and select directdraw

* then upgrade the installation to full

* then run lotd expansion

* then upgrade expansion to full

* upgrade using patch in iso folder (this is  a 1.12 patch, the 1.13  will not run)

* attach expansion iso

* then install plugy 

* download multires  (https://www.moddb.com/games/diablo-2/downloads/d2multires-version-102),  the  version  with 4  files from the  dev, not  the 2 file  one from reddit

* put files from zip into d2 folder

* edit plugy.ini
* Find this line " DllToLoad= " and replace it with " DllToLoad=D2MultiRes.dll "
* Also this line " NBPlayersByDefault=1 " and replace it with " NBPlayersByDefault=0 "

* create a shortcut that points to the plugy exe and add the -w flag to the target. if do not do this and run the game directly full screen, for some reason it has insane screen tearing. like literally unplayable.

* run borderless gaming to remove the windowing 

TADA.

I have also heard the butcher is back in D4 as a random event. This rubs me the wrong way. In terms of lore, my hero went to hell and back (LITERALLY) to chop the butcher in D1. Whatever, much like Tokyo Drift I can simply continue to choose to ignore the retcons and continue to live in the microcosm that I have created.

Stay tuned for the next episode of my pointless ranting and raving where I might even post about something useful. In the mean time I will be diving back into Diablo 2 because why not.
