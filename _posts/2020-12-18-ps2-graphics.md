You may be wondering, "why is a Simpsons obsessed poster not showcasing the improvements to one of the Simpsons games?" and the answer is simply I haven’t gotten around to getting those isos yet, while I had the Tokyo Drift game on hand from an aborted experiment to get it to run on a laptop with an atom cpu.
