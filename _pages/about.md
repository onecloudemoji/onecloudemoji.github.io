Sometimes I do things that I think are cool and forget about them. This page is more for me than you. Remembering that sometimes I do thing keeps the wolves at bay. Take what you can from these assorted, vaguely thematic musings. 

While you are venturing deeper into the Labyrinth you may find tomes of great knowledge hidden there. Read them carefully for they can tell you things that even I cannot. 

Remember to be lucky.
